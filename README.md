ember_playground
================

ember_playground is a skeleton application that can be used to quickly set up
a development environment for Ember.js apps that are backed by a Ruby on Rails
backend.

Setup
-----
After cloning this repository it should be enough to run bundler.

```
bundle install
```

You can then start your rails server and visit localhost:3000. You should be
greeted by a placeholder page.

After that I suggest you work through Tom Dale's introductory screencast [Building an App with Ember.js](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ga99hMi7wfY).

Notes
-----

* You can use Haml for templating.
* If you like Haml you can also use [Hamlbars](https://github.com/jamesotron/hamlbars) for handlebars-templating with this project.
* Twitter bootstrap is included in this project.
